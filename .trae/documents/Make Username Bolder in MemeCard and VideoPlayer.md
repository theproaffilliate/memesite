I will make the username bolder in the following components:

1.  **`components/MemeCard.tsx`**: Update the creator's username link to use `font-bold` (it currently has no font weight class).
2.  **`components/VideoPlayer.tsx`**: Update the creator's username to use `font-bold` (it is currently `font-semibold`).

This will ensure the username appears consistently bold across the application, matching the header style I updated previously.
