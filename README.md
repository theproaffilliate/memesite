# MEMEiD - Next.js + Tailwind UI (Starter)

## How to run
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:3000

## Notes
- This is UI-only starter. There are **no Supabase** calls included.
- Replace mock hooks and placeholder functions in `/lib` when you integrate Supabase.
- If you want the full ISO countries & languages dataset, ask me to add them.
